    <p> Nelson's Wedding Venture</p>

    <p> The day was July 20th, 2018, two souls would join as one in what they thought would be sunny, bright, day,
        but the being upstairs had a different plan, and wow, did it <span id="Raining"> _________
        </span>, Their closest of friends and family, totally 100 guests were quickly diverted into the back-up
        location, the clubhouse.
    </p>

    <p> The ceremony had begun with all indoors. Myself, the nervous future husband, best men at one side, Reverend at
        the other, watched as the beautiful bride-to-be made her way down the aisle, arms intertwined with her father.
        There was a moment that nothing else in the room seemed to exist but my eyes looking her smile. Her father
        grabbed
        my hand and placed into hers and wished us well. The Reverend began his speech and came to the process of the
        nuptial reciting and exchanging
        of rings. Our confidants handed the rings to the Reverend and then he proceeded to hand my future wife's ring to
        me. While
        in stride of handing me the ring, it slipped out of my hands and onto the floor. Our guest snickered and my
        future father-in-law continued to say, <span id="lifeTogether">
            ______________________________ </span> as I slowly collected myself after picking the ring up from the
        floor. </p>

    <p> The ceremony finished with the embracement of, my now, wife's lips caressing mine and then walking off through
        the alley surrounding by our guests clapping in happiness for our union.
        The wedding party, as well as, my wife and I settled down for a moment back in the bathroom area of the
        clubhouse before the reception would begin.
        Our wedding coordinator gathered us all together again and the DJ began the introductions. The first of our
        bridal
        party came out hyped up to the intro theme music of what they play on Monday Night Football. Then the time came,
        my newly married wife, Danie, and I,
        heard the drum intro starting, followed but the guitars, then the lead singer of Survivor beginning the lyrics,
        We walked into the reception to our favorite song growing up, "Eye of the Tiger",
        <span id="tigereye"> __________________ .

    <p> The night was filled of joy, memories, and re-connecting with family/friends we hadn't seen in a while. It was a
        night as well that seemed to fly by in a matter of seconds with all the busyness that it entailed. The next
        morning the newly joined couple woke up and said their final goodbyes to the guests that stayed at the same hotel they chose to 
        have their wedding night slumber at. It was a time that we were filled with a bit of sadness but the joy soon would far outweigh that 
        because we were getting ready to embark on an amazing 10 day, 11 night, trip around a beautiful European country. The trip was full of suprises.
        Due to a lack of rest and all the pure excitement, the first night of our arrival I fainted and was passed our for about 2 minutes providing a big scare to my new wife.
        We then followed our trip among Italy, to Tuscany, where we enjoyed wine and dinner at old time Winery. The days followed with trips to the Sistine Chapel, the 
        Franciscan monk town of Assisi, and a romantic ride on a gondola being serenaded to along the waters of Venice. It simply took our breath away and  <span id="italyTrip">
            ______________________________ </span>
       that we had quite a bit to talk about when we returned back to reality. Still, to do this day, my wife and I would
       love to make another trip back to Italy and venture to certain places. It also has sparked our interest in exploring other areas
       around the world to visit and celebrate other's cultures.
